Hi there! Identity is a funny thing. Our understanding of who we are as individuals, how we perceive ourselves, and how others perceive us all flow and change over time. In this vein, after a lot of self-reflection I came to realize a few years ago that I am transgender!

Understanding my relationship with my body and how I present to the world has been an immensely emotional and personal undertaking, one that has helped me put into words feelings that I realize I’ve always had, but just never quite knew how to explain. Ever since starting hormone replacement therapy (HRT) last October, I’ve felt so much more comfortable and authentically myself. For the first time, I truly feel like…well, *me*. And now I feel ready to share that openly and proudly with the world at large.

My pronouns are she/her. I’ll still be going by Sam —  at least for now. I’m still the same punny, nerdy software engineer with a flair for performing and for running Dungeons & Dragons campaigns, the same Sam that you’ve come to know and love; I’m simply finally sharing and freely presenting outside how I feel on the inside.

I am eternally grateful to be supported by such loving family members and friends throughout my journey. Right now, in this volatile climate in which the right for transgender people to simply exist as our true selves in public spaces is fiercely debated by those are not trans and who do not know or care to understand our lived experience, it is especially challenging to transition and come out publicly. To be honest, it’s terrifying. But I would rather face and overcome that fear living as my genuine self than sit in silence.

Happy Pride! From Richmond, with love. 🏳️‍⚧️
