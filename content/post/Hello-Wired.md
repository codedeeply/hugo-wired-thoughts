This is a welcome and primer post -- it's the first on this site.

## In the Wired

It's a bit ironic that this post is welcoming to you something on the "Wired" which is in actuality hoested on the Intenet: [NYXUS](https://nyxus.xyz) would argue in their work [Notes on Cyber-nIHILISM](https://nihil.nyxus.xyz/posts/hello-from-the-wired/) that
>Today, the Wired doesnâ€™t yet have autonomy. It is commonly conflated with the Internet, which is anything but autonomous. The Internet, RATHER, is the gentrification of the Wired, and your social media profile is the gentrification of your Wired self that your meatspace representative has built.
